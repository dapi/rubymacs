  "Automatically compile Emacs Lisp files.

A file might be compiled everytime it is saved or only when it's buffer
is destroyed.  This is controlled through the option `auto-compile-when'.

A file might be compiled (1) automatically, (2) after the user has been
asked, (3) never.

This behaviour depends on various variables described below. The function
`auto-compile-file-maybe' goes through various steps to decide what should
be done.  These steps are listed here.  After each step, if the behaviour
has been unambiously decided, all remaining steps, and therefor the
variables they depend on, don't have any effect.

0. If `auto-compile-flag' is set locally (as a buffer local value) obey
   it.

1. If `auto-compile-flag' is set globally to `ask-always' then ask the
   user.

2. If `auto-compile-concider-no-byte' is set to nil the file _might_ be
   compiles if and only if a byte file already exists. Otherwise if set
   to t file _might_ be compiled regardless if a byte file exists.

3. If the file is explicitly included or excluded then do as requested.

   The regexps in `auto-compile-include' and `auto-compile-exclude' are
   used for explicit inclusion and exclusion their values are lists of
   regular expressions.

   First the best match in each variable is determined independently.
   The best match is usually the longest matched string.  But if one or
   more of the regular expressions that are used to match at the end of
   a string (that is if it ends with $) then only the matches of such
   regular expressions are compared by size.

   Then the best match from each variable are compared.  If only one ends
   with $ then it wins.  Otherwise if both or none end with $ the longer
   one wins.

   This mechanism, while somewhat complicated, allow rather sophisticated
   rules.

4. For all others files the global value of `auto-compile-flag' decides
   what should be done.

   t                Compile file without asking.
   nil              Don't compile file.
   ask              Ask wether file should be compiled.
   compiledp        Recompile if compiled file exists; otherwise don't.
   compiledp-or-ask Recompile if compiled file exists; otherwise ask.

After the user was prompted whether to compile some file the choice can be
saved.  See option `auto-compile-remember'.

Before a file is actually compiled `check-paren' is called, which
in case of an unmatched bracket or quote positions point near the error.
When only compiling upon killing of a file-visiting buffers you can still
choose to always call `check-paren' when saving.  See option
`auto-compile-when'.

When turned on `auto-compile-mode' is in effect in all buffer visiting
Emacs Lisp files.  Though it might not have an effect in some of them as
described above.  You can also toggle automatic compilation on and off in
a given buffer using `toggle-local-auto-compile'.  This even works if
`auto-compile-mode' is not turned on."

  "Toggle the local buffer local value of `auto-compile-flag'.

This always toggles between t and nil.  If there is no local value yet
and the global value isn't a boolean then set the local value to nil.

This toggle is mainly intended for situations when you know that some file
compile temporarly won't compile without errors and/or warnings or even is
in an unbalanced state.

If your library is in an balanced state and `auto-compile-when' is
customized to check if it is well balanced this would annoyingly jump to
the error doing exactly what you wanted to avoid.  In order to prevent
this `auto-compile-when' is locally set to t if it's global value is 1.

After your library can be safely compiled again use command
`auto-compile-kill-local' to remove all relevant local variables.

You can use the command even when `auto-compile-mode' is not enabled,
allowing you to use this library in a less intrusive way only in situation
when you want to explicetly update or test your changes but not call
`byte-compile-file' manually."

are asked again.

If you have choosen to also save your choice then you have to call this

This will modify `auto-compile-include' or `auto-compile-exclude'.  If
this does not work multiple expressions in these variables might match the
file name.  Try using this command again or customize these variables
manually.

The modifications made by this command are only in effect in the current
session.  To save them permanently you have to use Custom.  You could also
use library `cus-edit++.el' which prompts when exiting Emacs and there are
unsaved changes to custom options.

If you have saved your choice by adding a file local variable this command
